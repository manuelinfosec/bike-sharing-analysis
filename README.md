# Bike Sharing Analysis

Bike sharing is a fundamenta service, commonly used in the urban mobility sector. it is easily accessible (as no driving license is required to ride a bike), cheaper then normal car sharing service (since bike maintenance and insustance are substantially cheaper than automible ones), and, finally, is often a fast way to commute within the city. Therefore, understanding the driving factors of bike sharing requests is essenential for both companies and users.

From a company's perspeqctive, identifying the expected bike demand in a specific area, within a specific time frame, can significantly increase revenue and customer satisfaction. Moreover, bike relocation can be optimized to futher reduce operational costs. From a user's perwspective, probable the most important factor is bike availability in the shortest wait time, which is obviously in alignment with the company's interests.

## Project Objective
In this project, I will analyze bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshare Washington, D.C., USA, for the period between January 1, 2011, and December 21, 2012. The data is aggregated on an hourly basis. This means that no initial and final locations of the individual rides are available, but only the total number of rides per hour. Nevertheless, additional meteorological information is available in the data, which could serve as a driving factor for identifying the total number of requests for a specific time frame (bad weather conditions could have a substantial impact on bike sharing demand).

Although the conducted analysis is related to bike sharing, the provided techniques could be easily transferred to other types of sharing business models, such as car or scooter sharing.
